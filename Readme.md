# Next character prediction: Shakespeare
## Data:
The data consists of 39 Shakespeare plays and plays written by other Elizabethan-era playwrights, all of which were downloaded as .txt files directly from Project Gutenberg.
The data only contains all the plays of Shakespeare without any labels

## Data Reference:
The Complete Works of Shakespeare [http://www.nzdl.org/cgi-bin/library.cgi?e=q-00000-00---off-0gberg--00-0----0-10-0---0---0direct-10---4-----dtt--0-1l--11-en-50---20-about-shakespeare--00-0-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-10&a=d&c=gberg&srp=0&srn=0&cl=search&d=HASH5dd34b413454f23260c776]

## Dataset:

## Key Asks:
â€¢	Create a language representation model based on Shakespeare text by creating a character prediction tool i.e. P(next character | previous set of characters) using an RNN
